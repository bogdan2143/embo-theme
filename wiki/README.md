This folder contains documentation for **EmboTheme**. It provides a highâ€‘level overview of the project structure along with details for every file.

EmboTheme is built around the WordPress Full Site Editing paradigm where HTML templates define the entire layout. Dynamic data is supplied by PHP classes located in the `inc/` folder, while small JavaScript modules take care of interactive behaviour. These modules interact with PHP via standard WordPress hooks and AJAX endpoints.

See [files.md](files.md) for a detailed description of how each part works and how the files relate to one another.
