# Directory `wiki`

This folder contains documentation for **EmboTheme**. It provides a highâ€‘level overview of the project structure along with details for every file.

Subfolders are split by language using ISO codes: `en` for English, `uk` for Ukrainian. Each document focuses on one aspect of the theme, allowing you to explore topics individually.

EmboTheme is built around the WordPress Full Site Editing paradigm where HTML templates define the entire layout. Dynamic data is supplied by PHP classes located in the `inc/` folder, while small JavaScript modules take care of interactive behaviour. These modules interact with PHP via standard WordPress hooks and AJAX endpoints.
